# simple_trace_rb

Dead-simple tracing. Logs to the Trace Event Format. Because it is such a thin wrapper, I do not distribute it as a library. There is simply too many ways someone could want this code to function differently, so rather than build the omni-solution, I've built the barebones app that you can customize (hopefully with minimal effort) to your use-case.

If you would like to use it, feel free to copy it into your app and make whatever changes you think make sense for your setup.
